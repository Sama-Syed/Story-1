        <p><b><i><h1>Early Life</h1></i></b></p>
        <p><i><h2>Robert Oppenheimer was born into a Jewish family in New York City on April 22, 1904 to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a wealthy textile importer. Julius was born in Hanau, then part of the Hesse-Nassau province of the Kingdom of Prussia, and came to the United States as a teenager in 1888 with few resources, no money, no baccalaureate studies, and no knowledge of the English language. He was hired by a textile company and within a decade was an executive there, eventually becoming wealthy. Oppenheimer's family were nonobservant Jews. In 1912, the family moved to an apartment on the 11th floor of 155 Riverside Drive, near West 88th Street, Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses. Their art collection included works by Pablo Picasso and Édouard Vuillard, and at least three original paintings by Vincent van Gogh. Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist, and who later founded the Exploratorium science museum in San Francisco.</h2></i></p>
        <p><b><i><h1>Career</h1></i></b></p>
        <p><i><h2>In 1924, Oppenheimer was informed that he had been accepted into Christ's College, Cambridge. He wrote to Ernest Rutherford requesting permission to work at the Cavendish Laboratory. Bridgman provided Oppenheimer with a recommendation, which conceded that Oppenheimer's clumsiness in the laboratory made it apparent his forte was not experimental but rather theoretical physics. Rutherford was unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge in the hope of landing another offer. He was ultimately accepted by J. J. Thomson on condition that he complete a basic laboratory course. He developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor, Patrick Blackett, who was only a few years his senior. While on vacation, as recalled by his friend Francis Fergusson, Oppenheimer once confessed that he had left an apple doused with noxious chemicals on Blackett's desk. While Fergusson's account is the only detailed version of this event, Oppenheimer's parents were alerted by the university authorities who considered placing him on probation, a fate prevented by his parents successfully lobbying the authorities.</h2></i></p>
        <p><b><i><h1>Scientific Establishments</h1></i></b></p>
        <p><b><i><h2>Manhattan Project:</h2></i></b></p>
        <p><i><h2>On October 9, 1941, two months before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a crash program to develop an atomic bomb.In May 1942, National Defense Research Committee Chairman James B. Conant, who had been one of Oppenheimer's lecturers at Harvard, invited Oppenheimer to take over work on fast neutron calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into with full vigor. He was given the title "Coordinator of Rapid Rupture", which specifically referred to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory at his building in Berkeley. The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including Robert Serber, Emil Konopinski, Felix Bloch, Hans Bethe and Edward Teller—kept themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make the bomb</h2></i></p>

        <p><b><i><h2>Trinity Project:</h2></i></b></p> 
        <p><i><h2>The joint work of the scientists at Los Alamos resulted in the world's first nuclear explosion, near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945. Oppenheimer had given the site the codename "Trinity" in mid-1944 and said later that it was from one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets. According to the historian Gregg Herken, this naming could have been an allusion to Jean Tatlock, who had committed suicide a few months before and had in the 1930s introduced Oppenheimer to Donne's work.
                   Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the Bhagavad Gita (XI,12):</h2></i></p>
            <p><i><h2>"divi sūryasahasrasya bhavedyugapadutthitā
            yadi bhāḥ sadṛṥī sā syādbhāsastasya mahātmanaḥ"</h2></i></p>
            <p><i><h2>"If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky,
            that would be like the splendor of the Mighty one"</h2></i></p>

         <p><i><h2>As he witnessed that the first Detonation of a nuclear weapon on July 16,1945,Oppenheimer's words were:</h2></i></p> 
         <p><i><h2>We knew the world would not be the same.Few people laughed,few people cried,most people were silent.I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture,the Bhagavad-Gita.Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says,<b><i>"Now Iam Become Death,the destroyer of worlds"</i></b>I suppose we all thought that,one way or another</h2></i></p>
